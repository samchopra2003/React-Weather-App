# React Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Use `npm start` to start the development server. This is a React Weather App, which was created as part of a course taught by Slobodan Gajic on FreeCodeCamp on YouTube. 
This app can tell you the weather and its forecast for the next five days of all major cities around the world (min. population 1 million).
